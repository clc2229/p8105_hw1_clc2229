# Problem 1

Here is a code chunk that creates a data frame with the following:
 
  * a random sample of size 10 from a uniform[0,5] distribution
  * a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2
  * a (length-10) character vector
  * a (length-10) factor vector
  
  
```{r sample chunk}
hw_df = tibble(
  random_sample_10 = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5),
  vec_logical_gt2 = random_sample_10 > 2,
   vec_char_10 = c("This","is", "a", "character", "vector", "with", "a", "length", "of", "ten."),
  vec_factor_10 = c("male","male","female", "female", "female", "male", "male", "female", "female", "male")
)
```
